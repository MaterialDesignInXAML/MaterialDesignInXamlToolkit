/// <summary>
/// This converter is used to apply an initial vertical offset (downwards) of the floating hint in the case where the
/// <see cref="SmartHint.FloatingTarget"/> is taller than the <see cref="SmartHint"/> itself. This is typically the case
/// if a fixed (large) height is applied to the host control (e.g. <see cref="TextBox"/> or similar). In these cases the
/// hint should not float directly on top of the <see cref="SmartHint.FloatingTarget"/>, but rather be pushed down to sit
/// on top of the text inside the <see cref="SmartHint.FloatingTarget"/>.
///
/// There is an edge case that need to be dealt with, which is when the host element allows for text to wrap (i.e. in
/// <see cref="TextBox"/> based templates). In this case, we need to take the  number of text rows/line count into account
/// in the calculation.
