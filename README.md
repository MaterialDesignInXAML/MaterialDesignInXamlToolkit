# ![Alt text](web/images/MD4XAML28.png "How Can I Use The Themes?") Source Code
To load the source project you will need Visual Studio 2015.  Don't worry if you have an earlier version, you can still use the compiled assemblies from NuGet (see below).  There are two demo projects in the solution, restore the NuGet packages and fire them both up.  One is a "pure" Material Design project, the other illustrates how to combine with Dragablz & MahApps.

# ![Alt text](web/images/MD4XAML28.png "How Can I Use The Themes?") How Can I Use The Themes?

* Install [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MaterialDesignThemes/) ```Install-Package MaterialDesignThemes```
* Configure App.xaml according to the [example](MainDemo.Wpf/App.xaml).
* For more information see the [Get Started guide](http://materialdesigninxaml.net/#getStarted).
